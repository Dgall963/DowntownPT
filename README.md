Personal Training services website is a site for a small fitness studio.  The primary purpose of the site is to use for practicing my web development skills, and to apply the tools I learn in class to a real project.  
The Home page contains one of the JavaScript features, a BMI Calculator that I learned how to make from a Udemy course.  
The second JavaScript feature is a contact form, located on the About Us page.
I used CSS:last-of-type on the About Us page to change the color of the h1 elements, which contain the titles for each column.  
The home page was designed mobile first, so it looks pretty good on most screen sizes without using media queries.  
I used two media queries on the ASbout Us page to change the layout based on screen size.  The layout starts as three columns on larger displays, changes to two columns on tablet sized displays, and converts to a single column on phones.
